You can download the [setup](http://jarvisniu.com/niv/Niv_Setup_v0.4.2.exe)
file or just download the [executable](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jarvisniu/Niv/master/exe/Niv.exe)  file.

## Usage

The current version hasn't support file extension register, 
so you need to set it manually as following steps:

1. Right click on the image file;
2. Select "Open With";
3. Click "Choose Other Program" if `Niv.exe` does not appear in the list;
4. Find the `Niv.exe` executable file and choose it;
5. Click "Open".
